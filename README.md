### Optimization in data analysis project

The purpose of this paper is to explore “one-at-a-time” coordinate-wise descent algorithms, and understand the utility they have and how even in some specialized problems they can beat other more popular optimization algorithms. We target this problem both from a theoretical and practical standpoint, testing the coordinate descent against some python scikit datasets.
